uMessage
Easily allows users to send/receive texts via their phone using an online web application. Allows SMS functionality without having to be near a phone, allowing users to seamlessly transition between their mobile device and computer.

This is repo for the server/web app of the uMessage system. The other portion is the mobile app, which enables Android phones to connect to the uMessage server - this thereby allows users to send text messages through their phone number via the web app.
